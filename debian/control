Description: A learning environment for Python suitable for beginners and children, inspired by Logo.
 PythonTurtle strives to provide the lowest-threshold way to learn (or teach) 
 Python. Students command an interactive Python shell (similar to the IDLE 
 development environment) and use Python functions to move a turtle displayed 
 on the screen. An illustrated help screen introduces the student to the basics 
 of Python programming while demonstrating how to move the turtle.
